database change lists the migration to run **before** deploying (`make migrate`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Chart image upload: a picture of a chart becomes an editable data table, a suggested chart type
  and a Vega-Lite spec.
  - `POST /jobs/extract-chart` (signed in) and `POST /guest/extract-chart` (no account);
    `GET /chart-extraction/options` reports which readers this deployment has, so the page offers
    only real choices.
  - The built-in reader is UniChart, a separate service (`services/unichart/`, set `UNICHART_URL`,
    optional `UNICHART_TOKEN`, optional `CHART_EXTRACTOR=unichart|llm`). No third party sees the
    image. When its result looks incomplete (several series, a pie, nothing numeric) and the person
    has agreed for that upload, the AI model (OpenRouter) is used instead; without agreement the
    built-in result comes back with a warning. A request for the AI model without agreement is
    refused. The guest route never calls the AI model.
  - Results are validated like any other chart table and marked as estimated unless the chart
    printed its values.
  - Not deployed yet: without `UNICHART_URL`, `POST /guest/extract-chart` answers 503 and
    `/chart-extraction/options` reports `local: false`.
- Image store: uploaded originals live in one table (`stem_images`) and are referenced by id from
  flowcharts and long descriptions, with `image_public` still deciding who may see them. Legacy
  inline `image_data_url` columns are kept for now. **Migrations `ee8798c827c8` and `b7d2e4f19a60` —
  run `make migrate` before deploying.**
- Job image retention: the source image of an upload job is deleted after the job finishes, or kept
  only when the person asked. `flask purge-job-images` removes expired ones and
  `flask migrate-images [--dry-run]` moves legacy inline images into `stem_images`.
- `CORS_ORIGIN_PATTERNS`: https origin patterns where `*` matches `a-z`, `0-9` and `-` only
  (for example `https://frontend-git-*-stem-accessibility.vercel.app` for Vercel preview
  branches). A pattern needs a literal domain after the last `*`; others are ignored.
  `tests/test_cors_patterns.py`.
- `tests/test_chart_extract.py`.
- Chart permalinks: `POST/GET /charts`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /charts/<chart_id>`,
  `PUT /charts/<chart_id>/sharing`, and the public `GET /c/<slug>`. A chart is its table plus a
  whitelisted config (chart type, columns, title, axis labels, category order); the server bounds and
  validates both (up to 5000 rows and 100 columns, 2 MB, 200 charts per account). Shared by link by
  default; `"public"` is accepted and stored, but there is no chart listing yet, so a public chart is
  reachable only by its link, like `"link"`. Table `charts`,
  **migrations 0005 and 0006 (`spec_json`) — run `make migrate` before deploying**.
- Charts can carry an optional Vega-Lite `spec`, returned with the chart and on the public link so a
  shared chart is described the way its author described it. It is stored as-is and never executed by the
  server, and only accepted if it is a Vega-Lite object up to 200 KB and 40 levels deep that contains no
  `url` anywhere (so it cannot make a viewer's browser fetch anything).
- `Create_Chart` research event type (the frontend logs it when someone chooses Chart on /create; unknown
  event types are a 400).
- `tests/test_charts.py`.

### Removed
- `POST /upload`, `POST /generate-summary` and `POST /generate-outline`. They ran the paid image pipeline
  (OCR, detection, LLM) and an LLM call with no sign-in and no rate limit, and nothing in the frontend called
  them (it uses the signed-in `POST /jobs/process-upload` and `POST /jobs/generate-summary`). Anything outside
  the app that called them directly must switch to the `/jobs/...` routes and send a Bearer token.

### Security
- Images sent to the AI model for chart extraction need the person's agreement for that upload; the
  server refuses without it, and guests (no account) can never reach the AI model.
- Rate limits no longer trust a forged `X-Forwarded-For`. The address is now the one the platform appended
  (counted from the right; one trusted hop on Cloud Run, none elsewhere; `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` overrides).
  Before, the leftmost entry was used, so any caller could get a fresh limit with every request. This applies
  to the guest write limits, the report limit and the long-description limit.
- `POST /longdesc` with an image now needs a signed-in account (text-only saves still do not), with a
  per-account hourly limit and a cap of 100 stored images.

### Fixed
- `POST /longdesc` returned 500 for every request: `long_descriptions.owner_id` is NOT NULL and the route
  never set it. It now stores a placeholder owner (`anonymous`; the /ld page has no sign-in). Because the
  endpoint is open to anyone, it also validates sizes (alt text 2,000 characters, description 50,000, title
  255, image 5 MB as a data: URL, slug 3-64 letters, digits, `-` or `_`), is limited to 30 saves per
  address per hour, and no longer returns SQL in its error responses (here and on `GET /longdesc/<slug>`).
  `tests/test_longdesc.py`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-10-11

Deployed to Cloud Run (us-west1) from commit 7fdad86. Migration 0004 (`reports`) was applied first.
Verified on the live service: `GET /guest/image` answers 400 without a token and 200 with one, a report for
an unknown page answers 404, the CORS preflight allows `X-Guest-Token`, and `GET /repo` answers 200.

### Added
- Try it (no account): `GET/PUT/DELETE /guest/image` and `POST /guest/claim`. A browser token
  (`X-Guest-Token`, hashed into `guest:<hash>`) owns one public image; guests cannot use uploads or AI, always
  share publicly, and are limited in size (200 nodes, 400 edges, text lengths) and rate (per token and per IP,
  per process). `claim` moves the image into an account after sign-up. Responses include `guest: true`.
- `POST /p/<slug>/report` stores a report (table `reports`, **migration 0004 — run `make migrate` before
  deploying**); `flask takedown <slug>` unpublishes and hides a page.
- CORS allows the `X-Guest-Token` header.
- `tests/test_guest.py`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-10-11

Deployed to Cloud Run (us-west1) from commit 47801cb. The database was already at migration 0003, so
`make migrate` was a no-op. Verified: `PUT /flowcharts/<id>/sharing` answers 401 without a token and
`GET /repo` answers 200.

### Added
- `PUT /flowcharts/<id>/sharing` with `{"sharing": "public" | "link" | "private", "image_public": bool}`:
  one setting that sets visibility and publication together (public = page + listed, link = page only,
  private = owner only). `POST /flowcharts` accepts `sharing`; responses include `sharing` and `image_public`.
- `image_public` column: the uploaded source image is served on public pages only when the owner opts in.
  **Migration 0003 — run `make migrate` before deploying.** It backfills `image_public = true` for rows that
  are already published, so existing public pages are unchanged.
- `tests/test_sharing.py` (`python -m unittest tests.test_sharing`).

### Changed
- `POST /publish/<id>` and `POST /research/<id>` (deprecated) now use the same helper. Setting
  visibility to public through `/research` also publishes, so a diagram can no longer be public but
  invisible. They keep working for the deployed frontend until the rename (issue #1).
- `GET /p/<slug>` reports `has_image` only when the source image is shared.

### Added
- `AUTH_MODE=dev`: run the API without a Supabase project (fixed local user, SQLite).
  Refused when `K_SERVICE` is set, so it cannot start on Cloud Run.

### Changed
- Documentation uses the project name "STEM-Accessibility". The `ACCESSFLOW_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  variable and the `accessflow-backend` Cloud Run service keep their names.

### Added
- `LICENSE` (University of Washington).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-11

Deployed to Cloud Run (us-west1) as revision `accessflow-backend-00003-hs9`.
Database: stamped at migration `0002`.

### Added
- Cloud Run deployment: `Dockerfile` (CPU-only torch), gunicorn entrypoint
  (`backend/wsgi.py`), `.dockerignore`.
- `RUN_JOBS_INLINE=1`: run each job inside the request that created it so the
  service can scale to zero; jobs stuck in `running` are reported as failed after
  `JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` env var for allowed browser origins.
- Alembic migrations via Flask-Migrate (`make migrate`). **Migrations:** `0001`
  baseline, `0002` Supabase `profiles` table + row-level security.
- `.env.example`, rewritten README.

### Changed
- LLM calls moved from `google-genai` to OpenRouter (`backend/llm.py`); models set by
  `LLM_MODEL_EDGES` / `LLM_MODEL_SUMMARY`. Model names sent by clients are ignored.
- OCR uses Application Default Credentials when `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` is unset.
- Tables are no longer created at startup; use migrations (`AUTO_CREATE_TABLES=1`
  restores the old behavior for throwaway SQLite databases).
- Hard-coded production CORS origins removed.

### Security
- `/jobs/*` require a login, and jobs are visible only to their creator
  (`jobs.owner_id`).
- Row-level security enabled on all backend tables (Supabase exposes `public`
  over its REST API). Service-account key files are git-ignored.

### Upgrading an existing database
Databases created before migrations existed (the schema already matches `0002`):
`flask db stamp 0002`. Fresh databases: `make migrate`.

## 0.0.0 — 2026-10-11
Snapshot of `stem-accessibility/flowchart-accessibility` at `main`, without
history, venv, local database or credentials.
